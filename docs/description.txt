BirdFish is a tool to control the behavior of lights for the purpose of
entertainment.

The overall design goal is to allow the person the the creative idea, to focus
more on the creative process of designing the way the lights behave at a high
level, and less about how to generate the timing required by the lighting
control hardware. Currently BirdFish is still for the technically inclined, and
is more about making really hard things possible than making standard stuff
super easy.
